  content: >
    As web applications grow, two things begin to happen. They scale to handle significantly more complicated and hence brittle, and they handle significantly larger traffic volume requiring more novel and complicated mechanisms to handle this traffic. This can lead to a death spiral for an application that can lead to brownouts, blackouts, and other quality of service and availability problems.
      
    This is Lee’s highly popular O’Reilly Media book, ***Architecting for Scale, Second Edition***.
      
    This book helps you avoid this death spiral by teaching you basic techniques for building applications that can reliably handle huge quantities of traffic, as well as huge variability in traffic without impacting the quality your customers expect.
      
    The second edition of the book is now available! This edition has been updated for 2020. The information has been dramatically updated and reorganized, and new information has been added on cloud computing and serverless computing. I hope you enjoy!
