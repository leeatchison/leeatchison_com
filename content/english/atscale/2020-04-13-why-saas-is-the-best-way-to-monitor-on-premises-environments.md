It’s past time to debunk an idea that’s somehow still kicking around in application performance monitoring circles. Put simply, just because you have an on-premises technology environment does not mean you need an on-premises monitoring solution. In fact, an on-premises monitoring solution has many disadvantages, even when dealing with purely on-premises environments.

Almost all companies still relying on on-premises environments also leverage the cloud in conjunction with their private data centers. So, as the lines between on-premises and the cloud continue to blur, the distinction between them becomes increasingly meaningless.

More to the point, perhaps, while forward-looking organizations understand that on-premises monitoring lacks the scalability, flexibility, and rapid innovation needed to deal with modern software environments, they may not yet realize that SaaS-based monitoring is also better at dealing with on-premises infrastructure.
