Scaling web applications isn't easy.

As web applications grow, two things begin to happen.
First, they become significantly more complicated and hence brittle.
Second, they handle significantly larger traffic volume requiring more novel and complicated mechanisms to handle this traffic.
This can lead to a death spiral for an application that can lead to brownouts, blackouts,
and other quality of service and availability problems.

My purpose for this blog is to provide techniques, guidance, and best practices for how to build web applications
that scale to significant traffic volumes.

### Why Me?

Most of the advice I am giving comes from my 28 years of industry experience, including a decade of working on large,
highly scaled applications.
I spent seven years working at Amazon.com where I lead the teams that built their first software download appstore
and built AWS's Elastic Beanstalk.
I hold several patents, including one while at Amazon for dynamically managing compute capacity in web based applications
(<a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20140156835" target="_blank">patent #20140156835</a>).

I've also spent the last nearly four years at New Relic, where I've been helping them architect their application to handle the
significant growth in volume of traffic, as well as the growth in the size of the engineering team needed to maintain
their applications...scaling is not just traffic, it's also scaling the development org to match.

## Architecting for Scale

I now specialize in all aspects of building scalable applications. This includes breaking up monolythic applications into
service and micro-service based applications, building highly available applications, risk management,
and team processes for scaling.

I've written a book on the topic of scaling applications.
It's called
<a href="http://www.architectingforscale.com" target="_blank">Architecting for Scale</a>,
and it's published by
<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920047070.do" target="_blank">O'Reilly Media</a>.
This book teaches techniques for building applications that can reliably handle huge
quantities of traffic, as well as huge variability in traffic without impacting the quality your customers expect.

## What I Do Now

In my current role as *Senior Director, Strategic Architecture* at New Relic, I help bring my knowledge and experience
to the industry and our customers thru speaking engagements, articles, and conversations.
If you are not aware of what <a href="http://www.newrelic.com" target="_blank">New Relic</a> does,
I encourage you to checkout our offering.
Many of the topics I discuss are facilitated by the tools that New Relic offers.
