Join me in Australia on October 17th and October 19th for our annual FutureStack conference in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia. I will be giving a new talk for the first time, "Keeping Modern Applications Performing -- Driving Insights to Action within the Enterprise". This is continuing my long standing tradition working "down under" with local customers on cloud computing and DevOps with both New Relic and AWS. Once again, I'll be available before and after the conferences for customer meetings and chats.

To register for one of these FutureStack conferences, please go [here](https://newrelic.com/futurestack/).

Additionally, for those of you in the San Francisco bay area, don't forget I'll be at our FutureStack San Francisco conference next week, September 11. Details can be found [here](https://newrelic.com/futurestack/sanfrancisco/).

Hurry, San Francisco is waiting-list only right now, and I'm sure Sydney and Melbourne will fill up fast!
