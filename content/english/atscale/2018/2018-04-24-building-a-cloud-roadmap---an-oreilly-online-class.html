	Hurry, there are a limited number of spots available, and registration closes on April 30th at 3pm PT. If you can't attend this session, there will be another one on June 21st. If the course is popular enough, I'm sure I will give it with O'Reilly at future dates as well. I would love to do a time/date that better works for EMEA and APAC audiences.
