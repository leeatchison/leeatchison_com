Join me at the xMatter's Flow 18 conference on October 22-24 at the Radisson Blu Aqua Hotel in Chicago, where I will be giving one of the keynotes for the conference.
I will be giving my newly created "Keeping Modern Applications Performing -- Driving Insights to Action within the Enterprise" talk, where it will make its North American debut. This will be hot on the trail after giving it down under in Sydney and Melbourne Australia the week before.
