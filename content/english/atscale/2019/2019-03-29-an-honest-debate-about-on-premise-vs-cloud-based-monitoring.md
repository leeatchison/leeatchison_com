Let’s have an honest debate about on-premise versus cloud app monitoring!

Application monitoring is a modern necessity for technology-based businesses across every vertical.

No matter whether you’re serving end customers or enterprise clients, a complete view of your applications and operating environment will help identify any problems before they escalate into serious customer service issues.

This has become especially true as more and more organisations have migrated to the cloud or adopted new working methods like DevOps.

However, there’s still a significant number of businesses who operate an on-premise technology environment.

This could be for several reasons, from legacy systems from which they aren’t ready to move from yet, or long-term business plans that require an on-premise solution.
