“First and foremost, the cloud provider is an expert in security. Use the tools and processes they provide and recommend in order to facilitate a highly secure environment,” said Lee Atchison, Senior Director of Cloud Architecture at New Relic. “These might differ from best practices you used on-premises, but that’s OK. AWS is an expert on security on AWS platforms. Use that expertise.”
