## Episode #6 -- Modernizing and Dynamic Infrastructures

In this episode, modern web applications have a lot riding on them. Our customers depend on them, and our business depends on them. Without modern web applications, many businesses would not survive. Modern web applications must scale to meet our biggest needs without suffering outages or other availability issues. In order to meet and exceed this high bar, we must build, manage, and monitor our applications using modern principles, processes, and procedures.

In this episode, we conclude our two-part series discussing the five guiding principles that a modern application requires in order to meet the expectations of a modern world.

And in Tech Tapas, what is STOSA and how does it help in operating modern digital applications?
