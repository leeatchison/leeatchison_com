## Episode #2 -- More Service Tiers and How Big is S3?

In this episode, we continue our three part series on Service Tiers, and how they can be used to prevent disasters in applications using service based architectures.

We also take another look at Amazon S3, and ask the question, how large is S3? The answer might surprise you.

All of this, in this episode of Modern Digital Applications.
