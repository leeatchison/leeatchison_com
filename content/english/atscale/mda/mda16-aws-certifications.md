Amazon Web Services provides a cloud certification program to encourage and enable growing your AWS cloud technical skills to help you grow your career and your business. Have you wondered what it takes to become AWS certified?

In this episode, join me with Kevin Downs, a trial by fire expert on the AWS certification program, while we discuss the AWS cloud certification program, and how to best utilize it.
