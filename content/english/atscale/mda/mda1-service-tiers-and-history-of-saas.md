## Episode #1 -- Service Tiers and History of Saas

Welcome to the inaugural episode of Modern Digital Applications! I hope you’ll find this podcast informative and helpful. My goal is to try and keep the episodes short, so that they can be consumed during a single morning average commute trip to work. This episode is only 11 minutes long.

Please, let me know how I am doing and what I can to improve.

In this episode, we begin a three part series on Service Tiers, and how they can be used to prevent disasters in applications using service based architectures.

We also take a look at Amazon S3, and the history of SaaS.
