## Episode #19 -- Future of Cloud Identity with Thomas Curran, p1

My guest today is Thomas Curran. Thomas is a cloud executive with many years of experience, including VP of Technology and Innovation at Deutsche Telekom and Technology Advisor at Deutsche Börse. He is the co-founder of the Ory Software Foundation, which is the owner of a very popular open source, go-based, identity management library named Kratos, along with other open source identity management tools.

Now, Thomas is co-founders of Ory Corp, an Open Source Identity Infrastructure and Services company.

Thomas is with me today from his office in Munich, Germany, to talk about application identity management.

As means of full disclosure, I’ve worked with Thomas personally for many years, first meeting him back when he was at Deutsche Börse. I’m now currently working directly with Thomas at Ory, architecting their new cloud infrastructure.
