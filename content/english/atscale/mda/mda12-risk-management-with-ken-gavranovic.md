## Episode #12 -- Risk Management With Ken Gavranovic

Ken Gavranovic was the Executive Vice President and GM for product at New Relic. In early 2019, Ken and I were in Boston together for an event, and we recorded an interview discussion about Risk Management in modern digital applications.

Both Ken and I have experience dealing with Risk Management issues in current and past assignments. I discuss Risk Management in my book, Architecting for Scale. Ken used a very similar risk management technique in his past corporate management gigs. In this interview, we compare notes and make recommendations on best practices for Risk Management that everyone can use.
