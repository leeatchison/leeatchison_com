## Episode #24 -- Learning from Incidents with Beth Long, p2

My guest today is Beth Long. Beth worked at New Relic where she held roles in both engineering and marketing, including two years leading the Reliability Engineering team, which owned the tooling and process for incident response and analysis. She also led New Relic's collaboration with the SNAFU Catchers, a group of researchers investigating how tech companies learn from incidents.

Beth recently left New Relic to join the startup Jeli.io, where she leads the engineering team working on the industry's first incident analysis platform.

This is part 2 of my interview with Beth.
