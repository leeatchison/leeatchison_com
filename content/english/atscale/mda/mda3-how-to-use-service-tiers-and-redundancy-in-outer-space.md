## Episode #3 -- How to Use Service Tiers and Redundancy in Outer Space

In this episode, we conclude our three part series on Service Tiers, and how they can be used to prevent disasters in applications using service based architectures.

We also take a look at the very first AWS service. Any guess what that service is?
