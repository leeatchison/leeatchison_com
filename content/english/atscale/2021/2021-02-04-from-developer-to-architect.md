Take a look at my latest course, available from LinkedIn Learning.

How is a software architect different from a developer? What exactly do architects usually do, and what additional skills would you need to become one? Instructor Lee Atchison answers these questions and more as he introduces you to thinking like an architect. Whereas a developer focuses on details, an architectâ€™s role requires letting go of the details in order to guide the process. A good architect evaluates proposed designs and methodologies and provides feedback to keep the big picture and all outside needs in mind. Lee walks you through a day in the life of the architect, which lets you see the roles that architects may fill for themselves and others. The modern architect needs to keep several principles in mind, and Lee discusses each one. He covers additional skills you need to develop to become a successful software architect, then concludes by walking you through how to discuss with your current manager your goal of becoming an architect.
