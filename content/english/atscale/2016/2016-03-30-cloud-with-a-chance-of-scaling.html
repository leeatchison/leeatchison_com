<p>As our applications grow, keeping them operational can be challenging. High growth means more data, more computation, and more opportunities for problems. The cloud offers us the ability to improve our scalability, while maintaining and improving our availability. During this talk, we’ll show you the “keep two mistakes high” principal and use the cloud to prevent availability issues, keeping our applications healthy and growing, yet keeping costs inline.</p>

<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>How can we keep our applications operational, even as the demand for them increases at an astronomical rate? Keeping our applications operational can be challenging. High growth means more data, more computation, and more opportunities for problems.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">How can cloud computing help our ability to grow our applications?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The cloud can be used as an improved data center, giving us the capacity we need, when we need it, to keep our applications running. Additionally, the cloud can provide us redundancy and parallel capacity that allows us to increase our tolerance to problems, reduce the risk of our application failing, and increase our ability to handle important compliance requirements.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As mobile and IofT applications become more and more prevalent, data handling at scale is becoming more and more critical. The cloud can help us here by providing us with unique and useful alternatives to traditional computing to help us keep our application operating, even with increased data volume.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">By giving us the ability to grow our computational capacity and our data handling capabilities essentially endlessly, the cloud gives us the ability to handle our increased user needs. Doing this in a way that doesn’t cost us a fortune, yet keeps our application highly available, does not come automatically. But it can be accomplished when the right techniques are used. </p>
