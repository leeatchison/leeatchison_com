Software Engineering Daily Podcast. Listen to Jeff Meyerson talk to Lee Atchison about Lee's new book, "Architecting for Scale", by O'Reilly Media.

<!--more-->

Lee Atchison spent seven years at Amazon working in retail, software distribution, and Amazon Web Services. He then moved to New Relic, where he has spent four years scaling the company’s internal architecture. From his decade of experience at fast growing web technology companies, Lee has written the book Architecting for Scale, from O’Reilly.

As an application scales, it becomes significantly more complicated while at the same time receiving more traffic. The intersection of these two problems leads to a variety of discussions around availability, risk management, and microservices. Lee and I didn’t have time to get through everything in his book Architecting for Scale, but if you enjoy this episode, check out the book. Lee also spoke recently at the O’Reilly Velocity conference in Santa Clara, so you can check out his talk.
