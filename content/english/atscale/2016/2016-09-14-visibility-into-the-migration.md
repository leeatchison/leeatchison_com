When I look back at my career over the last 30 years, it’s amazing to see how much the world has changed when it comes to building, running, and managing software. At my first job, for example, our company was trying to reduce its development cycle down to less than a year. Nowadays with cloud architectures we’re seeing development cycles of just weeks, days, or even hours. But that’s not to say that all cloud environments are dynamic and rapidly changing.

I like to think of the cloud in two different ways: static and dynamic. A static cloud is used just like a traditional data center, with resources that are statically provisioned. A dynamic cloud is an environment where resources are much more nimble, with resources being allocated only when you need them.

You can learn more about the difference between these two clouds, along with the potential challenges that come with moving from static to dynamic infrastructures, in the video below. In it, I also touch on topics like cloud migration, DevOps, and high scalability—all things you need to prepare for when making the transition.
