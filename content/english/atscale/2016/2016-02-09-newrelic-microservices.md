Take a look at the article 
[Microservice Architectures: What They Are and Why You Should Use Them](https://blog.newrelic.com/2016/02/08/microservices-what-they-are-why-to-use-them/), 
written by me and published by New Relic.

This is an update and extension to the article "Why Use Microservices?" written by me previously on this blog.
