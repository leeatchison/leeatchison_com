Did you think moving to the cloud would be easy? You’re not alone. Countless CTOs admit now that they had no idea how hard it would be and that they would make many mistakes along the way. What these leaders missed is that cloud excellence is as much cultural as it is technical.

Join O’Reilly Media in their next edition of Meet the Expert with me, Lee Atchison, to learn how to create a culture of cloud excellence. I will show you how to instill the cultural changes necessary to transform your organization into a true cloud organization, with lessons drawn from the hard-fought wisdom of CTOs around the world.

This session is free with an O’Reilly Safari membership.
