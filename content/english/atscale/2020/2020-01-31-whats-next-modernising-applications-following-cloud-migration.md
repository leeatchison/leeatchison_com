In 2020, many organisations have already embarked on some form of cloud migration, as part of their wider digital transformation strategy involving the adoption of DevOps, cloud-native solutions, and modern software technologies. With the growing expectations of customers and increasing concerns over reliability, scalability, and functionality of applications – companies must keep pace in order to satisfy business demands.

In a recent {{<extlink url="https://newrelic.com/press-release/20191016">}}global survey{{</extlink>}} of 750 global IT decision-makers, conducted by New Relic, the majority of respondents agreed that migration to public cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP is at the core of their digital transformation journey. This belief has resonated most in the U.S. (82%), followed by the U.K. and Australia (75%), and then France (66%).

Looking ahead into the next 12 months, it is evident that companies need to be able to harness the power of cloud to fuel their digital journeys. A large majority of the research’s respondents (46%) revealed that while migration to the cloud has been great, they don’t feel that they have a clear way of predicting what their cloud bill will be each month. Understandably over half of those surveyed (54%) shared that while cloud computing promises more efficient use of resources, the promise of greater control isn’t always a given.
