In 2018 I wrote {{<extlink url="https://diginomica.com/aws-lambda-kubernetes-future-serverless">}}Forget AWS Lambda, so long Kubernetes, this is the future of serverless{{</extlink>}} here on diginomica. My point in that article being that the future of computation was not going to be neither Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) offerings, such as AWS Lambda, nor the management of fleets of servers to operate containers, as is necessary for Kubernetes. The long-term destiny for computation was, in my opinion, operating containers on a serverless infrastructure. What I wanted was AWS Lambda for Containers. What I wanted was true Containers-as-a-Service (CaaS).
