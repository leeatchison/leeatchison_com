Cloud computing is mainstream. That’s a fact. Chances are if your company isn’t already extensively using the cloud, it is planning 
on doing so in the very near future.

But be careful…there are many mistakes that companies new to the cloud make when they begin looking into cloud adoption.

In this series of articles, I’ll look at the top three mistakes people make when adopting the cloud.
In the last article, we looked at the first mistake, which is believing the cloud is not secure.
In this article, we look at the second mistake.

## Mistake #2: Lift-n-Shift is a Cloud Migration

Early in the process of adopting the cloud, many companies consider moving applications to the cloud by simply taking the application 
off of servers running in their own data center and move them to servers they’ve created in the cloud.

This type of migration is often called a simple “Lift-n-Shift”.

Lift-n-shift is a valid way to very quickly get your application out of your data center and into a cloud-based data center. But while 
this approach is quick and easy, it isn’t typically very effective. This is because it doesn’t do anything to make your 
application “friendly” to the cloud.

And while there are some benefits to this approach: such as the ability to use cloud regions as a method of expanding your data center reach. 
That’s usually where the benefits o this approach stop. In fact, the cloud can actually be inferior at basic application hosting such as this 
than your own data center. This is true in one big area in particular: cost.

The cloud can and does provide significant cost benefits for users that take advantage of the dynamic allocation capabilities of cloud resources.

But when it comes to the static hosting of a fixed size application, the cloud typically can’t compare in cost to the basic, static 
infrastructure provided by a non-cloud data center. When you use the dynamic capabilities of the cloud, you can save money. If you 
simply lift-n-shift, you typically don’t save money. The economics of how the cloud works tend to work against you, and you often 
spend more and your overall bill is higher in the cloud for these types of applications.

In the next article, I’ll talk about the third and last major mistake people make during a cloud migration – believing that serverless 
can solve all your problems.
