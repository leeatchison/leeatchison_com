Sounds backwards, doesn’t it? Typically, the most logical answer for what to do with your most sensitive data is to keep it locked up and held close to your chest. The least likely place to put sensitive data is in the public cloud.

Security is very important to nearly all companies. Moving to the public cloud means taking my application that is safely behind my company’s firewall and putting it on a public cloud service.

How can I possibly trust the cloud to keep my application and my data secure?

But traditional wisdom doesn’t apply here. In fact, the safest place to keep your most sensitive data may, in fact, be in the public cloud.
