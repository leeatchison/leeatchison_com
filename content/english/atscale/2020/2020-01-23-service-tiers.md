Bringing down an entire application is easy. All it takes is the failure of a single service and the entire set of services that make up the application can come crashing down like a house of cards. Just one minor error from a non-critical service can be disastrous to the entire application.

Service Tiers are one way of helping minimize the impact of service failures across service dependencies. They are a technique I learned while working at Amazon, and they are a technique I recommend to everyone I work with.

I’ve written a lot on {{<extlink url="https://thenewstack.io/how-service-tiers-can-help-to-avoid-microservices-disasters/">}}service tiers{{</extlink>}}. 
I talk about them in my book, {{<extlink url="https://architectingforscale.com/">}}Architecture for Scale{{</extlink>}}. 
I gave a presentation on the topic at the {{<extlink url="https://leeatchison.com/2019/06/05/risk-management-avoiding-availability-disasters-in-service-based-applications/">}}2019 GeekWire Summit{{</extlink>}} in Seattle, WA. 
I’ve presented the concept to customers and at other conferences.

And recently, I started a three part series on the topic on my new podcast, {{<extlink url="https://mdacast.com/">}}Modern Digital Applications{{</extlink>}}.
