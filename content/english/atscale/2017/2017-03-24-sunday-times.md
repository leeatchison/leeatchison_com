Serverless computing is one of the hottest trends in tech, however it's also one of the most misunderstood.

From the article: Lee Atchison, senior director at analytics platform New Relic, warns: “Each service provides a different and unique method for offering serverless computing. This means that an IT professional who wants to take advantage of serverless computing will find they are locked into a single cloud service provider to a greater degree than if they use more standardised traditional server-based computing.”
