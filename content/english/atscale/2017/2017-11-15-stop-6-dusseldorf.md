After a quick stop for an important customer visit in Frankfurt, I headed to Düsseldorf for the next leg in our cloud roadshow.

Here we had a small crowd, half dozen people or so. Honestly, I was worried it would be dry and flat with such a small crowd. But on the contrary, the audience was very interactive and we had good discussions about cloud and cloud migration.

Among these customers, the public cloud was not as much of an immediate concern. Regulatory and other issues have kept most of the folks we talked to in their own data centers. Concerns about security and data sovereignty are important considerations for this group of customers. Keeping their company and customer data in country…or at least in the EU…was of serious concern for them. Resiliency and the ability to rollover to new data centers during outages was also a frequent discussion point. Doing that while maintaining the ability to stay in country was a nagging concern. Data sovereignty isn’t solved if contingency plans involve taking data out of country.

All-in-all, most of these folks were much earlier on their cloud migration than the typical customer I talk to. This helped me to remember that the ability to use the public cloud is still not a given in every industry and in every culture. Yes, I did know this before, but this event has helped that sink in and served as a reminder.

There was great general interest in the cloud and how dynamic infrastructures can help them in the future. Moving “faster” was not necessarily a compelling goal, but consistent progress was important. Tools like DevOps processes are tools that can help formalize development processes in a universal way.

Overall a great, albeit small, event with well informed and engaged attendees.
