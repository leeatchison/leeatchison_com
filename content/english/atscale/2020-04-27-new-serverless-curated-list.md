Serverless has become more and more mainstream. Cloud services like AWS Lambda are being deployed into critical production use cases. But is Lambda all there is to serverless? What else does serverless have to offer? And does serverless computing mean the ultimate demise of server based software?

I’ve written many articles on serverless computing over the last few years. I’ve now put all those articles together into part of my curated list collection. If you are interested in seeing a list of relevant content about serverless and serverless computing, then take a look at the [Serverless Curated List](/lists/serverless/).
