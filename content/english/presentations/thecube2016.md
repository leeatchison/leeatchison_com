Do companies really need a hybrid cloud? | #AWSSummit
by Amber Johnson | Jul 13, 2016

New Relic, Inc. is known for its horizontal integration business model. Lee Atchison, principal cloud architect and advocate at New Relic, stated the company’s movement is “up the value stack.”
Atchison and John Gray, SVP of Business Development at New Relic, joined John Furrier (@furrier) and Lisa Martin (@luccazara), cohosts of theCUBE, from the SiliconANGLE Media team, for an interview at AWS Summit 2016 in Santa Clara, CA.

Gray quoted statistics stating that 72 percent of enterprise businesses are in some form of cloud transition. With such a majority of the industry in play, it’s no surprise the cloud debate is making thunder roll. 

Atchison offered a unique perspective on AWS, as he was employed at Amazon while it was still in the monolithic application phase. Now, he observed that companies can not only monitor what a workload is doing but also make it faster or slower within the cloud. New Relic is also able to show customers the entire transformation from start to finish.

Nullifying the need for hybrid cloud

Atchison credited this to the SAS environment, stating companies “don’t need a separate solution” for on-premise and cloud. Atchison implied that hybrid is giving businesses “more to worry about.” Instead, New Relic can “handle all that.” New Relic is able to do this through its close partnership with AWS.

Gray remarked the two companies are “working closely” together. AWS has recently made New Relic one of only a handful of leading partners in its migrations category.

The process of migration goes like this: First, New Relic looks systemically at the application. Next, it splits it horizontally. The low-hanging fruit goes into the cloud first, followed by the more complex aspects. Ideally, the law of diminishing returns is applied to the process. This is done by asking one simple question: “Is this worth moving?”

Atchison determined that the major appeal of AWS is that applications of all sizes can be built and changed quickly.
