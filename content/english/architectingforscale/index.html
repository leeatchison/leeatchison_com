  <p>
    This is Lee's highly popular O'Reilly Media book, <em>Architecting for Scale, Second Edition</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    As web applications grow, two things begin to happen. 
    They scale to handle significantly more complicated and hence brittle, 
    and they handle significantly larger traffic volume requiring more novel 
    and complicated mechanisms to handle this traffic. 
    This can lead to a death spiral for an application that can lead to brownouts, blackouts, 
    and other quality of service and availability problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    This book helps you avoid this death spiral by teaching you basic techniques 
    for building applications that can reliably handle huge quantities of traffic, 
    as well as huge variability in traffic without impacting the quality your customers expect.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second edition of the book is now available! This edition has been updated for 2020. 
    The information has been dramatically updated and reorganized, and new information has 
    been added on cloud computing and serverless computing. I hope you enjoy!

        <h4>DevOps Reading List: Top 30 Best DevOps Books You Should Read In 2018</h4>
        <p>
          <img align="right" src="/images/atscale/book-sign.jpeg" alt="Architecting for Scale" width="122" height="109" />
          <span style="color: #999999;">by Ekaterina Novoseltseva, Apiumhub</span>
          <br />
          Architecting for Scale is the first book on their 
          <a href="https://apiumhub.com/tech-blog-barcelona/devops-reading-list-devops-books/" target="_blank">top 30 DevOps books you should read in 2018</a> list.
        </p>
        <p>
          &#8220;The first one on our DevOps reading list is Architecting for Scale. 
          It is an excellent book to understand real-world paradigms for scaling and managing critical applications. 
          This book covers 5 different elements: availability, risk management, services and microservices, scaling applications and cloud services. 
          This book can be called a practical guide as well, it shows how to prevent an application from becoming slow, inconsistent, or downright unavailable as it grows. 
          Also, in this book the word “Scaling” is explained very well as it is not just about handling more users; it’s also about managing risk and ensuring availability.&#8221;

  <h2 class="elementor-heading-title elementor-size-default">10 Tech Books for Summer Reading</h2>
  <img align="right" src="/images/logos/networkcomputing.png" alt="Network Computing" width="73" height="73"/>
  <h4>by Information Week/Network Computing</h4>
  <p class="lead">
    Architecting for Scale is book #3 on their <a href="http://www.networkcomputing.com/data-centers/10-tech-books-summer-reading/754721319" target="_blank">summer reading list</a>.
  </p>
  <div class="article">
    <p>
      &#8220;Summer is always a good time to catch up on some reading. 
      The days are long and theoretically at least, a bit slower. 
      And like most tech nerds, you'll want to spend that time expanding your IT know-how. 
      Perhaps you want to build more expertise in a certain domain or expand your horizons and 
      learn about a new area. In either case, we've got some books you'll want to check out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;Most of these tech books are hot off the press. 
      A few have been out for a bit, but haven't lost their sheen and remain highly relevant. 
      Many cover cutting-edge topics that were some of the hottest sessions at Interop Las Vegas this year, 
      including network automation, DevOps, and containers. In fact, some the authors, 
      such as network consultant Jason Edelman and eBay Network Software Engineer 
      Matt Oswalt, were popular speakers at the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#8220;With the rise of cloud and software-defined networking, 
      IT roles are changing so it makes sense for infrastructure pros to get familiar with emerging 
      technologies, hence our book choices. Who knows, perhaps one or more of these books will 
      inspire you to take a different approach in your work, or a whole new path in your IT career.&#8221;

    What is Single Team Owned Service Architecture (STOSA)? STOSA is an important guiding principle for 
    large organizations that have many development teams that own and manage services comprising 
    one or more applications.
